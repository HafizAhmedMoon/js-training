    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>"Chapter 1"</h2>
    <p>
      Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
      desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and
      all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
      thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite
      book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more
      she felt she needed to be free.

      She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with
      an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
      <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
      Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of
      the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
      outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better
      to do.
